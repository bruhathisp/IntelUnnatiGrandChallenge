Training a deep learning model on vehicle behavior data and using that model to make predictions on a test dataset. Here's an overview of what the code does:


It imports necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras.

It loads a training dataset (train.csv) and preprocesses it. This includes encoding the categorical target labels using LabelEncoder.

It defines a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras with several dense layers and softmax activation for multi-class classification.

It loops through each unique vehicle ID in the training dataset and performs the following steps:

a. Filters the training data for the current vehicle.

b. Splits the data into training and validation sets.

c. Creates a KerasClassifier with the defined model architecture.

d. Trains the model on the training data.

e. Evaluates the model's performance on the validation set and prints the validation accuracy.

f. Stores the trained model in a dictionary, where the vehicle ID is the key.

It loads a testing dataset (test.csv) and initializes an empty list to store predicted alerts.

It enters a real-time monitoring and feedback loop where it iterates through rows in the test dataset.

a. For each row, it retrieves the corresponding trained model based on the vehicle ID.

b. It prepares the input features for prediction.

c. It makes predictions using the model.

d. It converts the predicted class indices back to categorical labels.

e. It appends the predicted alert to the list of predicted alerts.

f. It checks if the predicted alert matches predefined behavior patterns and provides real-time feedback to the driver.

Finally, it saves the updated test dataset with predicted alerts to a new CSV file (test_with_predicted_alerts.csv).

This script demonstrates how to use deep learning to classify vehicle behavior based on input features such as location, vehicle ID, speed, and time, and provides real-time feedback to drivers based on the model's predictions. It also saves the predictions and feedback to a new CSV file for further analysis or reporting.
